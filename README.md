## 📆 Project Timeline

Admin

Project duration: 28 June to 4 August 2021 with a Showcase on 11 August.

- Design sprint: ideation to prototyping.
- Two 6-day build sprints:


🎨 Design process \

- Dicovery and definition workshops on [Miro board]().
- The initial prototype can be viewed on [Figma]().




<!-- Through our initial user research, we learnt that ice cream vendors are not keen to have their location shared constantly with customers, so would like to have full control of how visible they are on the map, and this impacted our final MVP design. -->

🔧 First Build Sprint \

- First focused on building the database and skeleton of the platform.


<!-- Initial set up of PostgresQL database
Set up Travis CI and Husky as part of initial setup
Deployment of frontend and backend from a monorepo
Finalized style guide
Set up React router for for the front-end to serve different pages -->


🔨 Second Build Sprint \
By the end of the second build sprint, we were able to :

<!-- Create the heatmap for ice cream vendors to view nearby customers who are interested in icecream
Set up codecov to monitor test coverage on the project
Add functionality for customers to let ice cream vendors know they would like ice cream
Include geolocation api tracking for customers -->
